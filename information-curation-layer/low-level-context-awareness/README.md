<!-- Main Body of the Document -->


# 1. Introduction

Information Curation Layer Low Level Context Server (ICL-LLCA) is a comprehensive real-time framework for recognizing a user context from the data generated by multiple sensors.
It offers multi-user, multi-threaded framework to recognize any kind of user context from any kind of data in real-time, with the concepts of _Plug and Play_ recognizer.
Below are the main concepts essential in understanding ICL-LLCA. 


## 1.1 Device

A **Device** refers to the physical device, which possess multiple type of sensors. For example, in current ICL-LLCA **Smartphone** device is composed of Accelerometer & Gyroscope & Magnetic inertial sensor data, food image, and  voice audio data which all can be gathered with the sensors in the smartphone. In ICL-LLCA, all devices it considers are registered in *org.uclab.mm.icl.llc.config.DeviceType* enum, and each of the DeviceType has its own instantiable data class, which extents *org.uclab.mm.icl.data.SensorData* interface.

## 1.2 Context

A **Context** refers to the context of user, such as the physical activity the user is performing or the emotional state of the user. In current ICL-LLCA, for example, **Activity** context is composed of 8 labels, which are "Eating","Running","Sitting","Standing","Walking","Stretching","Sweeping" and "LyingDown". In ICL-LLCA, all contexts it considers are registered in *org.uclab.mm.icl.llc.config.ContextType* enum, and all of the ContextTypes are instantiated as *org.uclab.mm.icl.llc.LLCManager.ContextLabel* data class, which having which ContextType it belongs to as composition.

## 1.3 Recognizer

A **Recognizer** is the core of ICL-LLCA, which takes *Device* instance as input, and produces *Context* instance as output. In current ICL-LLCA, for example, **InertialActivityRecognizer** recognizer takes device *Smartphone* as input, and produces context *activity*, with the inertial data in the device instance. In ICL-LLCA, all recognizerss it runs are registered in *org.uclab.mm.icl.llc.config.RecognizerType* enum, and for each of the RecognizerType enum value there exists a instantiable recognizer class, which inherits *org.uclab.mm.icl.llc.LLCRecognizer.LLCRecognize* interface.




# 2. Getting Started

This section describes the requirements and initial setting to run the ICL-LLCA


## 2.1 Requirements

- Java versions: Java 1.8 or newer 
- Tomcat version: 7.0 or newer

## 2.2 Installation

There is no explicit installation steps required to run the ICL-LLCA.
- To run the ICL-LLCA inside the Ecplise, download the code from github, install tomcat into Eclipse and run the project in the tomcat server.
- To run the ICL-LLCA with Tomcat outside the Eclipse, just place the *icl_whole.war* file in the */webapps* forder in Tomcat director, go to the */bin* directory and type
```
startup.bat
```


## 2.3 Usage

After starting the project in the Tomcat server, ICL-LLCA will run automatically. Some of the rest services it provides are as follows
- *icl/llc/version* will provide you the version and additional information of the running ICL-LLCA instance. 
- *icl/llc/updatesensordata* with this rest endpoint, you can provide **Device** data to the ICL-LLCA. 
- ...




# 3. Features

## 3.1 Plug and play recognizers

Recognizer is the core concept of ICL-LLCA, and it can be attached/detached from the ICL-LLCA with ease. To add the recognizer, you just need to inherit the *org.uclab.mm.icl.llc.LLCRecognizer.LLCRecognize* interface, properly implement abstract methods in the interface, and register your recognizer in *org.uclab.mm.icl.llc.config.RecognizerType* enum. Then it will begin to work to recognize User context ASAP in the ICL-LLCA. To turn off the recognizer, you can either unregister the recognizer from *org.uclab.mm.icl.llc.config.RecognizerType* enum or utilize the External Configuration file, iclconfig.json.

## 3.2 External Configuration File

iclconfig.json file, which is located in the root folder of the project, is used to configure the running instance of ICL-LLCA. You can change various things, such as period of the recognizers, uri of the Data Curation it considers. You can even turn on/off the recognizers. The change you made will take effect after restarting the server.
